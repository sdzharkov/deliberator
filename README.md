# deliberator

Instructions:
* Use ```python3 deliberator.py``` to run the script. 
* Use ```python3 deliberator.py startNum``` to run the script, starting at the startNum'th person. 
* report.csv has to be in the same directory, and be a downloaded csv from the typeform. 
* Friends of HackDavis members' names are listed at the top; they will be auto-accepted when their name comes up. 
* output.txt holds the names of the accepted members. 
* Currently, there is a hacked together method of getting the emails for each person that was accepted (by string matching names). 
* Saving emails would be a quick modification that would speed this process up.
